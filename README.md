# Face-detection-rpi
A generic face detection algorithm using haar-cascades and tweaking to improve the performance on raspberry pi 3.  

A group project for our robotics lab, 6th Semester, Jan-April, 19



 PROJECT STRUCTURE

 

RPI

-  	Figure out ip address
- ​	The commands for transferring files from rpi to laptop
    

CODING

- ​	Face trainer

-  	Haarcascade frontal face

-  	LBPHFacerecognizer module

-  	Image pipeline from folder os 	module

-  	Map image from folder with 	image id

-  	Grey-scale --> crop --> 	re-scale --> train --> save


DEBUGGING

-  	Opencv dependencies problems
-  	Rpi environment replicate on 	rpi
-  	Overcome build dlib problems
-  	Emulate environment on rpi
    

TWEAKING ( PERFORMANCE)

-  	Reduce resolution size to increase speed
-  	Improve dataset
